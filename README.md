-Description-


    Notes on Flaws:
    - The header 'scores' button and timer are not hidden on the 'highscores' page.
    - Despite hiding question lists, they are still given space in the webpage.
    - Elements do not all scale well when the page is resized.
    - Highscores page does not display elements by score value.
